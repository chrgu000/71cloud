class=\"dTitle\">\n      锻造新时代党的领导力    </p>\n    <p class=\"dDate\">\n      2018-08-15    </p>\n    <div class=\"dContent\">\n      <p>我们党团结带领人民走过97年风雨历程，谱写了人类历史上惊天动地的壮丽史诗。在我们党领导下，中华民族实现了从东亚病夫到站起来的伟大飞跃，实现了从站起来到富起来的伟大飞跃，迎来了从富起来到强起来的伟大飞跃。今天，我们比历史上任何时候都更接近、更有信心和能力实现中华民族伟大复兴的目标。所有这一切，都是在中国共产党领导下取得的，体现了中国共产党强大的领导力。党的十九大报告指出，中国特色社会主义最本质的特征是中国共产党领导，中国特色社会主义制度的最大优势是中国共产党领导，党是最高政治领导力量。新时代，我们党要在坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的历史进程中始终成为坚强领导核心，必须进一步锻造新时代党的领导力。</p><p>强大的领导力是中国共产党的显著标志</p><p>截至2017年底，中国共产党党员总数为8956.4万名，比上年增加11.7万名；党的基层组织457.2万个，比上年增加5.3万个。这样一个成立97年、执政69年的大党，带领亿万人民完成新民主主义革命和社会主义革命、建立起中华人民共和国和社会主义基本制度，带领亿万人民走过40年改革开放伟大征程、推动中国特色社会主义进入新时代，靠的是什么？靠的就是我们党强大的领导力。习近平同志指出：“中国共产党是世界上最大的政党。大就要有大的样子。”在“大的样子”中，党的强大领导力无疑是一个重要标志。</p><p>中国共产党强大的领导力，说到底是由党的指导思想决定的。中国共产党坚持以马克思主义为指导。马克思主义是科学的理论，创造性地揭示了人类社会发展规律；马克思主义是人民的理论，第一次创立了人民实现自身解放的思想体系；马克思主义是实践的理论，指引着人民改造世界的行动；马克思主义是不断发展的开放的理论，始终站在时代前沿。在人类思想史上，没有一种思想理论像马克思主义那样对人类产生了如此广泛而深刻的影响。坚持以马克思主义为指导，决定了我们党必然具有强大的领导力。</p><p>中国共产党强大的领导力，说到底是践行党的性质和根本宗旨所要求的。中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队，同时是中国人民和中华民族的先锋队。作为先进的马克思主义政党，中国共产党始终以全心全意为人民服务为根本宗旨，始终着眼于实现好、维护好、发展好最广大人民的根本利益，因此能得到人民群众的衷心拥护和支持。</p><p>中国共产党的领导力是一种大“道”，而非小“术”。这个大“道”植根于党领导革命、建设、改革的伟大实践，在新时代则植根于党领导人民坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的伟大实践。深刻认识中国共产党的领导力，就要善于运用马克思主义辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义、运用马克思主义党建理论来观察和研究领导力问题。毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观、习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想中的党建思想，是马克思主义党的学说和党建原理同中国革命、建设、改革的实践紧密结合的产物，形成了中国化的马克思主义党建理论体系，内容十分丰富，其中蕴含的领导理念、领导价值观、领导方略和方式、领导制度和艺术，深刻体现了中国共产党的强大领导力。</p><p>强调锻造新时代党的领导力，是由我们党肩负的历史使命所决定的。我们党清醒地认识到，实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标和中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，在前进道路上还面临许多矛盾、困难、风险和挑战。我们党要始终成为时代先锋、民族脊梁，始终成为马克思主义执政党，自身必须始终过硬。为此，党的十九大报告把“不断增强党的政治领导力、思想引领力、群众组织力、社会号召力，确保我们党永葆旺盛生命力和强大战斗力”这个重大课题提到全党面前。锻造新时代党的领导力，就要不忘中国共产党人的初心、牢记中国共产党人的使命。只有这样，我们才能站得更高、看得更远、想得更实，把我们党建设好、建设强，形成更加强大的领导力。</p><p>锻造新时代党的领导力要以提升政治领导力为灵魂</p><p>毫无疑问，政治领导力是中国共产党领导力的核心范畴。中国共产党是有政治信仰、政治纲领、政治路线、政治纪律的政治组织，政治属性是中国共产党的根本属性。从我们党带领人民长期奋斗的历史经验看，党的政治领导力集中体现在坚持马克思主义指导思想，用一脉相承、与时俱进的马克思主义中国化的科学理论武装全党、教育人民；体现在正确制定并执行党的政治纲领和政治路线，推动党的事业朝着正确方向前进；体现在建立健全坚持和加强党的全面领导的组织体系、制度体系、工作机制，切实把党的领导落实到改革发展稳定、内政外交国防、治党治国治军等各领域各方面各环节；体现在坚持和完善党的民主集中制，维护党中央权威和集中统一领导，引导全党增强“四个意识”，自觉在思想上政治上行动上同党中央保持高度一致；等等。因此，党的政治领导力理所当然在中国共产党领导力中居于首要的、核心的位置。</p><p>党的政治领导力不能孤立地存在和发挥作用，必须同党的思想引领力、群众组织力、社会号召力等形成一个有机整体。党的思想引领力、群众组织力、社会号召力寓于党的政治领导力之中，受党的政治原则、政治规矩的指引和约束，并为提高党的政治领导力提供实现途径和有力保障。只有自觉把政治领导力作为中国共产党领导力的灵魂和统领，才能真正形成中国共产党强大的领导力、号召力、凝聚力和战斗力。</p><p>正因为党的政治领导力如此重要，党的十八大以来，习近平同志高度重视党的政治建设，强调“党是最高政治领导力量”，指出“讲政治，是我们党补钙壮骨、强身健体的根本保证，是我们党培养自我革命勇气、增强自我净化能力、提高排毒杀菌政治免疫力的根本途径”；提出“把党的政治建设摆在首位”，强调“党的政治建设是党的根本性建设，决定党的建设方向和效果。”在中共中央政治局第六次集体学习时，习近平同志更是强调“党的政治建设决定党的建设方向和效果，不抓党的政治建设或背离党的政治建设指引的方向，党的其他建设就难以取得预期成效。”在实践中，党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央展示了高超的政治领导力，形成强大的政治导向、政治定力和政治引领，以巨大的政治勇气、强烈的责任担当解决了许多长期想解决而没有解决的难题，办成了许多过去想办而没有办成的大事，推动党和国家事业发生历史性变革。我们要深入总结和研究其中的经验和规律，在新时代不断提升党的政治领导力。</p><p>锻造新时代党的领导力要以提升领导干部的领导力为基础</p><p>党的干部是党的事业的骨干和中坚力量。没有领导干部领导力的提升，就没有党的整体领导力的提升。从某种意义上说，领导干部的领导力是党的全部领导力的基础。因此，提升领导干部的领导力，是提升党的领导力必须下功夫完成的重要任务。</p><p>领导干部的领导力主要体现在两个方面，一是政治过硬，二是本领高强。所谓政治过硬，主要是指对党政治上忠诚，牢固树立“四个意识”；理想信念坚定，始终坚定“四个自信”；注重政治担当，善于从政治上观察和处理问题；做到政治自律，严格遵守党的政治纪律和政治规矩。此外，各级领导干部特别是高级干部要提升把握方向、把握大势、把握全局的能力，提升辨别政治是非、保持政治定力、驾驭政治局面、防范政治风险的能力，做到善于从政治上分析问题、解决问题。尤其需要强调的是，领导干部做到政治过硬，就要坚决维护习近平同志党中央的核心、全党的核心地位。党的十八大以来，习近平同志在领导党和国家事业发展、领导开展具有许多新的历史特点的伟大斗争中，赢得了全党全国各族人民的衷心爱戴和坚决拥护，成为党中央的核心、全党的核心。领导干部要更加自觉、更加坚定地维护习近平同志的核心地位，维护党中央权威和集中统一领导，在思想上政治上行动上同以习近平同志为核心的党中央保持高度一致。</p><p>所谓本领高强，要求领导干部全面增强执政本领。习近平同志在党的十九大报告中提出“全面增强执政本领”，并从学习本领、政治领导本领、改革创新本领、科学发展本领、依法执政本领、群众工作本领、狠抓落实本领、驾驭风险本领八个方面提出明确要求。这些要求最终都要落实到领导干部身上。比如，领导干部要增强改革创新本领，就要保持锐意进取的精神风貌，善于结合实际创造性推动工作，善于运用互联网技术和信息化手段开展工作；领导干部要增强狠抓落实本领，就要坚持说实话、谋实事、出实招、求实效，把雷厉风行和久久为功有机结合起来，勇于攻坚克难，以钉钉子精神做实做细做好各项工作；领导干部要增强驾驭风险本领，就要健全各方面风险防控机制，善于处理各种复杂矛盾，勇于战胜前进道路上的各种艰难险阻，牢牢把握工作主动权。</p><p>锻造新时代党的领导力要以人民群众对党的拥护、支持和追随状况为标尺</p><p>我们党来自人民，植根人民，服务人民。习近平同志在党的十九大报告中指出，中国共产党人的初心和使命，就是为中国人民谋幸福，为中华民族谋复兴。这个初心和使命是激励中国共产党人不断前进的根本动力。党的领导力体现为党对社会、对人民群众的影响力。没有人民群众的拥护、支持和追随，领导力必然落空。党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚持以人民为中心，把人民对美好生活的向往作为奋斗目标，把党的群众路线贯彻到治国理政的全部活动之中，以高度的政治自觉和可贵的政治勇气全面从严治党，以一系列带有突破性的重大举措开辟管党治党新境界，赢得了广大人民群众发自内心的拥护和支持，党的领导力不断彰显，党的威信日益提高。</p><p>中国共产党能够由一个最初只有50多名党员的政党，在极其艰难困苦的条件下迅速发展壮大，不仅夺取了全国政权，而且领导一个世界上人口最多的国家从一穷二白走向繁荣昌盛，就是因为得到了最广大人民的拥护和支持，获得了永无穷尽的力量源泉。一个能够得到最广大人民拥护、支持和追随的政党，必然是一个具有强大领导力的政党。锻造新时代党的领导力，要紧扣民心这个最大的政治，把赢得民心民意、汇集民智民力作为重要着力点。广大党员、干部要站稳人民立场，贯彻党的群众路线，同人民想在一起、干在一起，始终保持党同人民群众的血肉联系，着力解决人民群众最关心最直接最现实的利益问题。</p><p>（执笔：虞云耀）
